# Thorlabs-TH10K
Code and circuit to measure temperature using Thorlabs’ TH10K and arduino due that is an epoxy-coated 10 kΩ thermistor with 0.010" lead wires with a nickel/PTFE insulating coating. This thermistor is suitable for mounting in a probe or on a PCB for temperature measurement, control, and compensation


# Description
The temperature sensor is built using an NTC 10k thermistor, which changes its resistance in response to changes in temperature. The resistance of the thermistor is measured using the Arduino's analog input, and the temperature is calculated using the Steinhart-Hart equation.
